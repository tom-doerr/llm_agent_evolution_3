# Tasks to Address Remaining Issues

## High Priority
- [x] Fix LLM integration tests
- [x] Fix evolution tests
- [x] Improve error handling

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Split large modules (main.py, statistics.py)
- [ ] Reduce function complexity
- [ ] Standardize naming conventions
- [ ] Remove code duplication

## Low Priority
- [ ] Optimize imports
- [ ] Fix line length issues
- [ ] Add more assertions to tests

## Implementation Plan
1. Split main.py into smaller modules
2. Extract functionality from statistics.py
3. Simplify complex functions
4. Clean up remaining code style issues
